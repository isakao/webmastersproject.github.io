          <p>Fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to global warming and pose threats to our planet. The resulting rise in global temperatures leads to severe weather effects such as melting ice caps, sea levels, and overall disruption of our ecosystems. However, through green energy initiatives, we can help reduce the effects of this global crisis. </p>

          <div class="paragraph-style-1">
            <p>Green energy initiatives are efforts to promote the adoption and use of renewable energy sources and sustainable practices. These initiatives aim to reduce the use and reliance of fossil fuels and overall mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gasses and climate change through environmentally friendly technology. </p>

            <p>The EPA is the United States governmentâ€™s independent agency that deals with environmental protection. This agency contains numerous renewable energy and energy efficient programs:</p>
            <li>Green Power Partnership is a program that encourages organizations to buy renewable energy, like wind or solar power, to reduce their environmental impact from electricity use.</li>
            <li>AgStar promotes the use of biogas recovery systems on farms to capture methane emissions from animal waste, helping to reduce greenhouse gasses and providing farmers with renewable energy.</li>
            <li>ENERGY STAR, a collaboration between the EPA and DOE, promotes energy-efficient products and practices to save money on energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li>WaterSense, led by the EPA, encourages water efficiency by promoting water-saving products and practices, helping to conserve water resources and lower water bills.</li>
            <p>More information can be found directly on the Environmental Protection Agency website: <a class="active" href="https://www.epa.gov/">epa.gov</a></p>
